# divide-and-conquer-leetcode
*Divide and conquer all leetcode problems.*

## Introduction
Every one trys to learn various methods to solve leetcode problems.
However, few people grasp the core of all algorithms and 
therefore most of us cannot solve novel problems we didn't seen before.

To overcome all these problems, 
I want to have a experiment on **solving every leetcode problem with divide and conquer**.
If I can prove this, give me your star;
If I fail, no regret.

## Spirit
- Use `divide-and conquer` purely.
- Ok if pass all leetcode tests.

## Setting
To be practical, I only use *Java* and *C++* for all experiments (although Scala and Rust are better).
The world has not been prepared for everything.

## Strategies
We can classify `divide-and-conquer` algorithms based on how they divide problems.
- Type 0: init part :+ the last element
- Type 1: Equally divide into two parts

For more details, please refer to the Strategy doc.

## Epilogue
Fuck leetcode, long live `divide-and-conquer`!
